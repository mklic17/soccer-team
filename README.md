# Soccer Teams

Created for Web Development and Cybersecurity. This is a ruby on rails application that will allow admins to create a soccer team and then other users can join the team. You will be able to view the stats of the team such as other users, dominant foot, and then a fun fact about the player.

This application is for anyone who wants to try to manage their soccer team and players. This application will alleviate some of the disorganization that comes with running soccer teams.
