# Soccer Teams

Created for Web Development and Cybersecurity. This is a ruby on rails application that will allow admins to create a soccer team and then other users can join the team. You will be able to view the stats of the team such as other users, jersey number, place of birth, and position.

How it will work is that I, the owner, will manually create a select few admins for coaches. These Coaches can create a team, and wait for other users to join. Everyone will be able to view the teams, players, and stats for each team. However, admins are the only ones who are able to get to the create the team page. Each user will only be able to join 1 team. On their profile it will say what team they are apart of.

This application is for anyone who wants to try to manage their soccer team and players. This application will alleviate some of the disorganization that comes with running soccer teams.
